# Maia SDR ADALM Pluto firmware

This repository contains the modified ADALM Pluto firmware for the
[Maia SDR](https://maia-sdr.org) project. See
[analogdevicesinc/plutosdr-fw](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/plutosdr-fw)
for the default ADI firmware.

## Support

Support is handled through Github issues or dicussions. Issues dealing with the ADALM Pluto
firmware itself (building the firmware, flashing the firmware, etc.) should go
as
[issues in the plutosdr-fw repository](https://github.com/maia-sdr/plutosdr-fw/issues).
Issues having to do with Maia SDR (software or FPGA bugs, features requests, etc.)
should go as [issues in the maia-sdr repository](https://github.com/maia-sdr/maia-sdr/issues).
There are also
[Github discussions in the maia-sdr repository](https://github.com/maia-sdr/maia-sdr/discussions)
for any topics which are not issues (general questions, comments, etc.).

## Build instructions

Using the `maiasdr/maia-sdr-devel` Docker image from
[maia-sdr-docker](https://github.com/maia-sdr/maia-sdr-docker) is recommended to build
the firmware. To build the FPGA bitstream, Vivado 2021.2 is required.

Once the environment variables and `PATH` have been set as indicated in the
[Docker container README](https://github.com/maia-sdr/maia-sdr-docker#readme),
the firmware can be built using
```
make
```
